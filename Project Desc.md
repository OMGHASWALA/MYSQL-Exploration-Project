Title: Exploring Sales Data with MySQL: A Data Analyst's Portfolio Project

Description:
In this project, I explored a sales dataset using MySQL, a popular relational database management system. The dataset contains information about customers, products, sales representatives, and sales orders. The project includes a series of SQL queries that answer various business questions related to sales, such as identifying the highest credit limit given to a customer, determining the top-selling product lines, finding the sales representative with the highest sales, and analyzing the annual sales trend.

By working with this dataset and using MySQL, I developed skills in data querying, data manipulation. The project showcases my ability to apply SQL knowledge to real-world business problems, and provides insights into the sales performance of a company. The project can serve as a valuable addition to my data analyst portfolio, demonstrating my proficiency in working with SQL and analyzing complex datasets.
